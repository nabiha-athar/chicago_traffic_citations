# Chicao Traffic Citations -- create a database detailing traffic citations in Chicago from raw data. 

Language: SQL 

Created a database from raw data to track details such as the date that the ticket was issued, the location and zip code of the violation, a brief description of said violation, the vehicle make and the license plate type. We created an ERD model based off of this data and wrote our CRUD queries to pull data. 

ctc_database_creation: the code used to create the physical database

ctc_queries: the CRUD queries used to demonstrate how the data can be extracted

ctc_report: a full reprot detailing our thougts, processes, and development of this project.
